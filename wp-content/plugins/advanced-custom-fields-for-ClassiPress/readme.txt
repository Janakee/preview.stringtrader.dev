  * Ad Fields - ad fields management

  * Export/Import/Clear Settings

== Installation/Update ==


This ACF plugin was developed for a specific version of ClassiPress! After every ClassiPress update, the plugin's source code needs to be reviewed. This may take some time, depending on what has changed with Classipress' new release.

Be prepared that if you upgrade ClassiPress before the release of a compatible ACF plugin - the plugin will turn itself off (in order to avoid potential errors). The plugin will reactivate itself on the condition that it's version is compatible with the version of ClassiPress.




Manual installation:

        ClassiPress 3.2 will come with significant changes. This causes a big changes in the plugin.
        Therefore one version of the plugin does not work at the same time with CP3.1.9 and CP3.2.
        To avoid confusion and problems with the installation,  in a plugin zip file added two versions of the plugin.


  * Download the Plugin zip file advanced-custom-fields-classipress.zip.

  * Extract the contents of the zip file.
    You will see two zip files:
        - advanced-custom-fields-classipress3.1.9-v1.0.2.zip - for ClassiPress 3.1.8-3.1.9
        - advanced-custom-fields-classipress3.2.1-v1.1.2.zip - for ClassiPress 3.2-3.2.1

  * Select the appropriate version for version Classipress.
    Extract the contents of the zip file.

  * Upload the contents of the zip file to the wp-content/plugins/ folder
    of your WordPress installation.

  * Then activate the ACF plugin from plugins page.

  * Find the menu "ClassiPress" on the WordPress administration page. Select the lower point "ACF options" and proceed to configure the plugin.



Manual update:
